NGINX listens on port 80 and forwards requests based on path prefixes:


| URL Path Prefix | Proxied To                 | Internal Port |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- |
| `/service1`     | Go service (service\_1)    | `8001`        |
| `/service2`     | Flask service (service\_2) | `8002`        |
